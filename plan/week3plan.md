# 3rd week

## Learn NumPy
If you get error that numpy is not defined, please run

pip install numpy 

Try the following code to understand the NumPy library. You could also try to write your own code to use NumPy library
``` python 
import numpy as np

print(np.sum([1,2,3]))

matrixA = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
vectorA = [1,2,3]
print(np.dot(matrixA, vectorA))
matrixB = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]
print(np.dot(matrixA, matrixB))

matrixC = [[1,2,3], [1,2,3]]
print(np.subtract(matrixA, matrixC))

print(np.add(matrixA, matrixC))

print(np.add(matrixA, 1))

print(matrixA)

print(np.array(matrixA))
```

Create your own class Matrix, which has
```python 
class Matrix:
    def __init__(self, rows, cols):
        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.data = [[0.0 for j in range(cols)] for i in range(rows)]

```
and add a few methods on it, so that you could perform dot, add, subtract operations. You will define static methods, for example
``` python

    @staticmethod
    def add(matrixA, matrixB):
        if (matrixA.rows != matrixB.rows):
            raise Exception("matrix rows not match")
        if (matrixA.cols != matrixB.cols):
            raise Exception("matrix cols not match")
        
        ret = Matrix(matrixA.rows, matrixA.cols)
        for i in range(matrixA.rows):
            for j in range(matrixA.cols):
                ret.data[i][j] = matrixA.data[i][j] + matrixB.data[i][j]
        return ret
```
And then you could compare your Matrix implementation with numpy implementation.

## Perceptron
* Learn the simplest neural network, Perceptron, algorithm and implement it using pure Python https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-perceptron-algorithm-scratch-python/

A sample perceptron is:
```python 
import random

class Perceptron:
    def __init__(self, inputNodeCount):
        # initialize the weight with random number from -1 to 1
        self.weights = [random.uniform(-1, 1) for x in range(inputNodeCount)]
        # initialize bias
        self.bias = random.uniform(-1, 1)
        self.learning_rate = 0.02

    def guess(self, inputs):
        sum = self.bias
        for i in range(len(self.weights)):
            sum += self.weights[i] * inputs[i]

        # use very simple function as activation function
        # It only return -1 or 1 based on sign
        if (sum < 0):
            return -1
        return 1

    def train(self, inputsAndTargetList):
        sum_error = 0
        for inputsAndTarget in inputsAndTargetList:
            inputs = inputsAndTarget[0: len(self.weights)]
            # last element is the target
            target = inputsAndTarget[-1]
            prediction = self.guess(inputs)
            err = target - prediction
            sum_error += err* err
            self.bias = self.bias + self.learning_rate * err
            for i in range(len(self.weights)):
                self.weights[i] = self.weights[i] + self.learning_rate * err * inputs[i]
        print(f'error={sum_error}')


class Point:
    def __init__(self, x = None, y = None):
        if (x is None):
            x = random.uniform(0, 300)
        if y is None:
            y = random.uniform(0, 300)

        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        if x > y:
            self.label = 1
        else:
            self.label = -1

def train_and_predict():
    trainingPoints = [Point() for i in range(100)]
    inputsAndTargetList = [[p.x, p.y, p.label] for p in trainingPoints]

    # create a brain, who only has 2 inputs
    brain = Perceptron(2)
    for i in range(5):
        brain.train(inputsAndTargetList)

    print(f"bias={brain.bias}, weights={brain.weights}")

    testingPoints = [Point() for i in range(50)]
    correctCount = 0
    for pt in testingPoints:
        prediction = brain.guess([pt.x, pt.y])
        if (prediction != pt.label):
            print(f"Wrong prediction for ({pt.x}, {pt.y})")
        else:
            correctCount+= 1
    # print out accuracy
    print(f"{correctCount} out of {len(testingPoints)} are correct")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    train_and_predict()
```

## Understand Neural Network

* Also watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU "Building a neural network FROM SCRATCH", which will help you to understand the Neural Network

* Follow the "Building a neural network from scratch" Youtube video and start to rebuild the project.

# 4th week
* Finish the project by follow the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU "Building a neural network FROM SCRATCH"
